# Inventory Manager
A Python program that manages shoe inventory for a warehouse.

## Description
This program is a Nike warehouse manager that allows the manager to capture, view, edit, search and report on shoe inventory. The program enables the manager to keep a record of the shoe inventory and provides statistics for presentation purposes.

At startup, the program retrieves data from an external text file to access the information needed to run the program and then presents the manager with the program menu.

The external text file contains the following on each line:
* Country that's holding the stock
* Product code
* Name of product
* Cost of product
* Quantity of stock

From the menu, the user is able to:
* Search for a stock item by product code
* View all stock items in the inventory list
* Capture a new stock item
* View the stock item with the lowest stock and update it
* View the stock item with the highest stock and discount it
* Calculate the value of each stock item
* Exit the program

## Programming principles

This program employs the programming concepts of Python OOP including classes, methods and functions. Furthermore it employs fundamental programming techniques that include external databases, lists, comparison operators, conditional logic, loops, indexing and string handling.

## Dependencies
```
from tabulate import tabulate
```
Used to create tables from shoe data.

## Running the program

Run the inventory.py file in any Python IDE.
View the inventory.txt file in any text editing program.

**Note**: The inventory data is stored in the inventory.txt file. Do not edit this file manually as it will cause errors in the program.

def capture_shoes():
    """Prompts the user to enter the country of origin, shoe code, product name, unit cost, and quantity.

    If an invalid cost or quantity is entered, the user is prompted to re-enter the input.
    The function then creates a new shoe object using the input and appends it to shoes_list.

    Returns:
        Confirmation that new object is added to list + text file
